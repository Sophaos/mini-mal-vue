This project was generated with Vue version 3.3.11.

## Motivation

My motivation was to learn Vue with the Composition API by building an application that uses a public API to view the details of anime and manga, similar to MyAnimeList.

## What I've learned

- Using Vue with the Composition API
- Utilizing the PrimeVue component library
- Implementing data fetching with Vue Query (tanstack/vue-query)

## What I've used

- Vue
- TypeScript
- Vue Query (tanstack/vue-query)
- PrimeVue
- PrimeFlex

## How to run

Run the following command: `docker compose up`

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
